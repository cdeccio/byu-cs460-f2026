# CS 460 Networking Reference

This is a consolidated reference for the packet structures implemented in CS 460. The diagrams describe the bytes handled by the labs, not every field that appears on a physical network.

## Overview

Each packet structure is shown separately below. The columns are bit positions within a 32-bit row; fields are labeled above the space they occupy. The Ethernet frame is simplified to simply show eight bits per column, with the row being all the bits in an Ethernet frame, rather than just 32 bits.

A table giving the **Field**, **Size**, and **Description** of each field follows. There is another column called **Example** giving example bytes for each field. Asterisks are for fields where bytes are shared between fields. In these cases, a short paragraph titled **Shared Bytes** follows the table for an explanation.

Finally, at the bottom is all the bytes from the example concatenated together, giving a complete example of a given packet structure.

## Ethernet

### Ethernet frame

<tr><th>00</th><th>08</th><th>16</th><th>24</th><th>32</th><th>40</th><th>48</th><th>56</th><th>64</th><th>72</th><th>80</th><th>88</th><th>96</th><th>104</th></tr>

### 802.1Q VLAN Ethernet frame

<table border="1" style="border:3px solid black;">
<tr><th>00</th><th>08</th><th>16</th><th>24</th><th>32</th><th>40</th><th>48</th><th>56</th><th>64</th><th>72</th><th>80</th><th>88</th><th>96</th><th>104</th><th>112</th><th>120</th><th>128</th><th>136</th></tr>
<tr><td colspan="6">Destination MAC</td><td colspan="6">Source MAC</td><td colspan="4">802.1Q Header</td><td colspan="2">EtherType</td></tr>
</table>

| Field | Size | Description | Example |
| --- | ---: | --- | --- |
| Destination MAC address | 6 bytes | Intended receiver; `ff:ff:ff:ff:ff:ff` is broadcast | `01 02 03 04 05 06` |
| Source MAC address | 6 bytes | Sender on the local link | `aa bb cc dd ee ff` |
| 802.1Q header | 4 bytes | An optional tag to support VLANs | `81 00 00 19` |
| EtherType | 2 bytes | Identifies the payload protocol | `08 00` |
| *Payload* | *variable* | Usually an IPv4 datagram or ARP packet. | N/A |

For the 802.1Q header field, the most significant (left-most) 16 bits of the 802.1Q 
header should have the value `0x8100` to indicate that it is an 802.1Q frame. 
The least significant (right-most) 12 bits of the 802.1Q header should contain 
the value of the VLAN ID. The 4 bits in between can be left as zero.

```text
01 02 03 04 05 06 aa bb cc dd ee ff 81 00 00 19 08 00

**Shared Bytes:** Asterisks are for bytes that are shared between fields. Byte ``45`` is ``01000101``: the first four bits, ``0100``, contains Version ``4``, and the last four bits, ``0101``, contains IHL ``5``. Byte ``00`` is ``00000000``: the first six bits are ``0`` for DSCP, and last two bits are ``0`` for ECN. Bytes ``40 00`` are ``01000000 00000000``: the first 3 bits, ``010``, are the Flags (Reserved ``0``, Don't Fragment/DF ``1``, More Fragments/MF ``0``), and the remaining 13 bits are the Fragment Offset, ``0``.

**Shared Bytes:** Asterisks are for bytes that are shared between fields. Bytes ``50 12`` are ``01010000 00010010``: The first four bits ``0101`` are the Data Offset, equaling ``5`` words (20 bytes). The next three bits ``000`` are Reserved, which is just set to ``0``. The next three bits ``000`` are for ECN, and the last six bits, ``010010``, are the Control Bits, equaling ACK + SYN (using the order URG, ACK, PSH, RST, SYN, FIN). The packed fields concatenate as ``0101 000 000 010010``.

## Various Notes

### Endianness

In this class, **network byte order** will be used, which is **big-endian**. You likely will not have to worry about this at all in this class, but this needs to be noted.

Examples below use the same numeric value in both byte orders. The bit order within each byte does not change; only the order of complete bytes changes.

| Value size | Numeric value | Big-endian bytes | Little-endian bytes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1 byte | `0x12` | `12` | `12` |
| 2 bytes | `0x1234` | `12 34` | `34 12` |
| 4 bytes | `0x12345678` | `12 34 56 78` | `78 56 34 12` |

For example, the 16-bit value `0x1234` is transmitted as `12 34` in network byte order. Optional further reading: [Endianness - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endianness).

### Layering Options

These are the main protocol combinations used in the labs:

```text
Ethernet Frame -> IPv4 -> UDP
Ethernet Frame -> IPv4 -> TCP
Ethernet Frame -> IPv4 -> ICMP
Ethernet Frame -> ARP
```

Note that you may not construct these full combinations. For instance, in the first lab, link-layer, you will only construct the Ethernet Frame - no payload inside it. However, it is important to remember how the OSI model behind this uses abstraction layers.
