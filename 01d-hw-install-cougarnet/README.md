# Hands-On with Cougarnet

The objective of this assignment is to familiarize you with the Cougarnet
framework, which will be used for completing your lab assignments for this
class.


# Installation

## Install Dependencies

Use the following commands to install the build and run-time dependencies for
Cougarnet:

```bash
sudo apt install openvswitch-switch tmux python3-pyroute2 iptables lxterminal python3-pygraphviz libgraph-easy-perl tcpdump wireshark socat
```

Follow the instruction at the top of [this page](https://deb.frrouting.org/)
to install FRR from the FRR Debian Repository.  (Note that FRR is available
from the main Debian repository, but the Debian version is outdated and buggy,
so it should be installed from the FRR Debian Repository instead.)

## Install Cougarnet

Clone the Cougarnet repository, then build and install it using the following
commands.

*Important:*  These commands must be run _outside_ of any shared folders that
you have configured (see the [previous homework](../01a-hw-create-vm/)).

```bash
git clone https://github.com/cdeccio/cougarnet/
cd cougarnet
sudo pip3 install --root-user-action ignore --break-system-packages .
```


## Configure System

 1. Run the following to create the group `cougarnet` and add your user to it:

    ```bash
    sudo groupadd cougarnet
    sudo usermod -a -G cougarnet $USER
    ```

    Now log out of LXDE and log back in, so your user is a member of the
    `cougarnet` group.  The privileges associated with this group membership
    will be explained in the next instruction.

 2. Run the following to edit `/etc/sudoers.d/99-local`

    ```bash
    sudo visudo -f /etc/sudoers.d/99-local
    ```

    Note that `/etc/sudoers` is the configuration file for `sudo`.  On many
    systems, files in the directory `/etc/sudoers.d` are "included" by
    `/etc/sudoers`, and it is preferred to create local configuration (i.e.,
    overriding the default) in files in this directory, rather than modifying
    `/etc/sudoers` directly.  Finally, the proper way to to modify the `sudo`
    configuration (whether `/etc/sudoers` or an included file) is using the
    `visudo` command, as shown above.  This opens an editor (by default `nano`)
    to securely edit the file.

    Add the following contents to this file:

    ```
    %cougarnet  ALL=(ALL:ALL) NOPASSWD: /usr/local/libexec/cougarnet/syscmd_helper
    ```

    Exit `nano` by pressing `Ctrl`+`x`.

    This will allow members of the `cougarnet` group to run the command
    `/usr/local/libexec/cougarnet/syscmd_helper` as `root` using the `sudo`
    command, without prompting for a password (`NOPASSWD`).  The script
    `syscmd_helper` is a script that runs in connection with Cougarnet to
    execute privileged operations associated with virtual network creation and
    configuration.

 3. Configure the FRR routing daemon on your system:

    a. Open `/etc/frr/daemons` for editing using the following command:

       ```bash
       sudo -e /etc/frr/daemons
       ```
  
       
       Enable the BGP and RIP daemons by modifying the lines containing "bgpd",
       "ripd", and "ripngd" to have the value "yes" instead of "no" (e.g.,
       "bgpd=yes" instead of "no" (e.g., "bgpd=yes").

       Find the line containing the commented-out `frr_global_options` option.
       Immediately below that line, add the following line:

       ```
       frr_global_options="-w"
       ```

       This will pass the `-w` option to every routing daemon, so it will work
       properly with Cougarnet.

    b. Restart FRR by running the following:

       ```bash
       sudo systemctl restart frr.service
       ```


# Exercises

1. Look through the
   [Cougarnet documentation](https://github.com/cdeccio/cougarnet/blob/main/README.md).
   While much of it might not make sense just yet, you will be referring back
   to this as you work on the labs.

2. Complete the six
   [Working Examples](https://github.com/cdeccio/cougarnet/blob/main/README.md#working-examples)
   Please note that you might not understand much what you are looking at in these exercises.
   We will be covering these concepts in great detail in future coursework. The idea here is to
   expose you to the Cougarnet framework and to make sure that your installation is working
   properly.
